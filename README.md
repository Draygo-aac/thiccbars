### Options
* Thicc Bars - Turns on or off the custom nameplates
* Auto-Tiling: Not recommended, but prevents (mostly) nameplates from overlapping. In practice this causes slight movement to completely change the location of a nameplate. Hopefully this feature can be improved in the future
* Shift: When enabled, holding shift will 'click through' the nameplate. hold this key when casting a ground target aoe to avoid clicking on nameplates
* Control: See above, but hold control
* Transparency: Sets the transparency of the nameplate, default 100
* Width: Total width of the namepate, default 100
* HP Height: Height of the HP bar, default 28
* MP Height: Height of the MP bar, set to 0 if you wish to hide MP. default 4
* Debuff Icon Size: Adjusts the size of the debuff Icons that appear in the nameplate. default 16
